## ðŸš€ Getting Started

#### 1. Clone and Install

_*It's recommended that you install [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/releases)._

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone [repo]

# Install dependencies
npm i
```

#### 2.1. Run the _React Native_ App

```bash
# Start the React Native packager
npm start
```

Instructions are shown in the terminal. You can select to open it in:

- An emulator (either iOS or Android)
- Your mobile device with the [Expo app](https://expo.io/). It will reload if you save edits to your files and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

#### 2.2. Run the _Web_ App

```bash
# Starts are local live-reload server at:
# http://localhost:3001
npm run web
```

Via webpack, starts a localhost server on port 3001 [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

- Save code and it auto refreshes
- Install [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) into Chrome to see the state of Redux
